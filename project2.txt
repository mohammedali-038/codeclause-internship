PROJECT NO.2 
 To begin with what exactly is this friendship?? Friendship is a closed bond shared between two or more people where they are emotionally connected, share their problems and help them in need. The key factor of friendship is trust and loyalty; a bond can never be shared if there is no trust between people. 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IN FRIENDSHIP TWO PERSONS ARE PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER.
Of course, it is possible to have romantic feelings or kind of desires for your friend and often friends get engaged in a bond where there they lack emotional support, and they find vulnerable enough to begin physical relationship where they find ok get intimated and there some people who hide their feelings thinking it might ruin their bond. For example, let's take an example of two films which is prevalent to this project “FREINDS WITH BENEFITS “AND “NO STRINGS ATTACHED”. Both the films try to explore modern relationships which are messy, complicated yet toxic at times. Both the movies explore the concept of casual relationships versus committed ones. It reminds us that different people have different expectations, and it's crucial to be on the same page about the nature of the relationship to avoid heartache.  in the film, character’s friendship provides a strong foundation for their relationship. Trust and a genuine connection can form the basis for a successful partnership. And it is becoming quite common to have this type of friendship apparently Iam not judging them but more you get physically involved with a person the less emotional support you’ll get from your partner and connections can develop naturally between two people spending time together intimately. Emotions can't always be compartmentalized, and it's crucial to acknowledge and address them when they arise.

WHY YOU NEED TO OPT FOR FRIENSHIP BEYOUD PHYSICAL ATTRACTION.
Often, we confuse ourselves between love and lust we think we must do at the end in any romantic relationship is to get physically intimate I completely understand that notion, but sex is not everything there are several aspects to look beyond it like emotional intelligence, support, spirituality and many more things.  We realize this thing much later perhaps we try to fit into the standards of desirability so that the other person shouldn’t feel bad. The way we talk, the way we behave, we need to look after everything. But friendship doesn’t lay conditions at all, it’s probably the comfort zone you will ever experience you don’t have to pretend or whitewash yourself you’ll be completely yourself because in the end they know you fully they won’t judge you. 
 Many people view friendship beyond sex as a natural and healthy aspect of human relationships. It is seen to connect deeply with others without the complications that can arise from romantic involvement.
•	Communication is very important. It solves the biggest problems whenever you feel like desires, or these kinds of feelings arise try to talk it's important to have a conversation with your partner or a friend.
•	Having transparency or a clear understanding with your friend is essential. Many times, we have flaws, and we try to hide them. As we move forward this gets problematic more complicated the bond gets.
•	For the sake of a few minutes of pleasure don’t ruin a healthy relation we all are vulnerable in some or the other way, but the vulnerability should be tackled with an open mind. And please try to deal with the vulnerability assertively, accept it and try to move forward.
•	It's important to draw certain lines/boundaries in any relationship be it friendship or something. If the boundaries are not drawn, then things will get messy and at a point there will be a point where you cannot even face yourself or your partner.
conclusion
See Iam nowhere no judge people based on their ideology towards their sex life or friendship But, all I can say is wait for the right time and a right person and everything will happen accordingly. If there is respect, mutuality and care for each other you don’t need any extra thing, you are fit enough to have a good life and each moment of your life.
