NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND WHY IS TO SO IMPORTANT: -
•	FOREIGN POLICY: The set of strategies, principles, and actions adopted by a country to interact with other nations and protect its interests on the international stage
•	RESOLVING ISSUES AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL: Many times, this has happened where different countries had to gather to protect their interest on the international stage. The issues might be regarding security, human rights or any issue that they may be facing at a global level.
•	EXCHANGE OF GOODS AND OPINIONS: with better relations and mutual business and marketing skills the countries can exchange their goods and valuable opinions. This will give people the experience of buying and selling their goods from other countries
•	INTERNATIONAL LAW: The legal frameworks and conventions that govern relations between countries and address issues like territorial disputes, human rights, and war crimes.
•	COMING FORWARD AS A HELPING HAND: sometimes allied countries get to face issues like poverty, development assistance, refugee crisis etc. So, in a particular situation one country should come forward and help the other country who is in need.
•	INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND ECONOMICS:  study of economic relations between countries, including trade agreements, tariffs, and the impact of global economic trends on individual nations.
WHERE DO ALL THE COUNTRIES GATHER TO ISSUE ALL THESE GLOBAL ISSUES, VIEWS: -
All countries gather to discuss global issues at various international forums and organizations. The primary venue for such discussions is the United Nations (UN), which serves as the main global organization for multilateral diplomacy and cooperation. The UN provides a platform for all member states to come together and address a wide range of global challenges. The UN General Assembly is where representatives from all member countries meet annually to discuss and debate international issues, adopt resolutions, and make decisions on various matters.
Other important international forums and organizations where countries gather to discuss global issues include:
•	G7 (Group of Seven): An informal group of seven major advanced economies, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The EU is also represented in the discussions. They meet annually to discuss economic policy, global security, and other shared concerns.
•	World Trade Organization (WTO): Deals with international trade and trade-related issues, providing a platform for negotiations and dispute resolution among member countries.
•	World Bank: Focuses on providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries for development projects and poverty reduction efforts.
•	International Monetary Fund (IMF): Provides financial cooperation and stability among member countries and offers policy advice and financial assistance to address economic challenges.
•	World Health Organization (WHO): An agency of the UN that deals with international public health issues and responses to global health emergencies.
•	United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): Concentrates on education, culture, and communication to promote peace and development worldwide.
•	Regional Organizations: Various regional organizations, such as the European Union (EU), African Union (AU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and others, address regional challenges and facilitate cooperation among member countries.
 Through these platforms, countries can foster international cooperation and work together to address challenges that transcend national borders.

WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN IF THERE ARE NO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OR UNITED NATIONS:
1.	We won’t be having any authoritative body to address various issues and problems at an international level.
2.	We can’t trade or sell other goods from various countries; this will affect the scale of globalization or global market.
3.	No country is going to come forward and help the country in their needy times.
4.	No funds. Loans or development assistance.
5.	This is going to affect the economy of a country on a global scale.

CONCLUSION:
It's important for all the countries to improve good relations with all the countries as individuals we can do things to some extent but together, we can do wonders. As we move forward it is essential for all the countries to have mutual thinking and proper understanding to come to the point of a problem.
